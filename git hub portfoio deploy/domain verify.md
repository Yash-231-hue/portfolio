Pages Add a verified domain
Add a DNS TXT record
Before we can verify cswebsite.com, you'll need to complete these steps:

Create a TXT record in your DNS configuration for the following hostname:
_github-pages-challenge-Yash-231-hue.cswebsite.com

Use this code for the value of the TXT record:
fafd8544ac881fdbcd6b6e69844f20

Wait until your DNS configuration changes. This could take up to 24 hours to propagate.
